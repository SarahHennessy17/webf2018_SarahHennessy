           <i><a href="https://sarahhennessy1.github.io/collection/board.html">Hennessy Collection</a></i>— This collection is a game that I created using information and images of my family. I included vintage family photos, photos from my personal collection and photos saved on the deepest parts of old family computers. This piece speaks to reoccurring themes in my work of family, interactivity and challenge. In this game, when the user chooses to start they are greeted with a collection of images that when clicked reveals a question relating to the person featured in the image. Occasionally the person that is in the image is "cutout" — covered in green to conceal who the question is about for an added challenge. <br></p>
