	<h1>Casey at the Bat</h1>

	<img src="images/book1.png">

		<p><i>Casey at the Bat</i> is a famous baseball poem, originally called <em>“Casey at the Bat: A Ballad of the Republic Sung in the Year 1888”</em>.
		This book was designed in collaboration with <a href="https://www.dertbook.com/" target="_blank"><b>DERT</b></a>, for their DERT Spreads Literacy campaign. I illustrated this classic poem for the modern kid. Building off of the energy that builds during a baseball game, the book grows in color as the sound and energy of the game build. The artwork for this book was inspired by the work of <a href="http://www.leroyneiman.com/" target="_blank">LeRoy Neiman</a>, who was known widely for his contemporary sports paintings. </p>
